I studied engineering for my bachelor's degree. I taught myself Python from edx and took DevOps classes, which helped me land a position at my first organization. There, I was fortunate enough to work on domains like e-commerce and Android apps and even contributed to the development of PHP apps and containerization, which polished my technical skills. After that, I joined my current organization, which focuses on core banking projects. Here, my previous manager was a great mentor. Noticing my zeal to learn, he encouraged me to learn Kubernetes and Ansible. For some time, I was the single point of contact, an opportunity I will be forever grateful for. I learned and achieved a lot in this job. This role further enhanced my skill set and clarified my career goals.

I recently came across an amazing opportunity that aligns with my career goals and expertise, so I applied and am exploring this opportunity."
