For a **DevOps/software interview at a large MNC bank**, you can expect **Ansible** questions that focus on **automation, configuration management, and security**. Here are some key **concepts and questions** they might ask:  

---

### **1. Ansible Basics**
- **What is Ansible, and how does it work?**  
  *Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool that uses YAML-based playbooks and an agentless architecture to manage infrastructure.*  
- **How is Ansible different from other configuration management tools like Puppet or Chef?**  
  *Ansible is agentless, uses YAML for playbooks, and has a simpler learning curve.*  
- **What are inventory files in Ansible? How do you define dynamic inventories?**  
  *Inventory files list managed hosts (static or dynamic using scripts/plugins like AWS EC2, Azure, GCP).*  

---

### **2. Playbooks & Roles**
- **What is an Ansible playbook?**  
  *A YAML-based file defining automation tasks for multiple hosts.*  
- **What are roles in Ansible, and why are they important?**  
  *Roles are reusable sets of playbooks, variables, templates, and handlers to organize large projects.*  
- **How do you structure an Ansible project?**  
  ```
  site.yml  
  roles/  
    ├── webserver/  
    │   ├── tasks/main.yml  
    │   ├── handlers/main.yml  
    │   ├── templates/  
    │   ├── files/  
    │   ├── vars/main.yml  
  ```

---

### **3. Modules & Ad-hoc Commands**
- **What are Ansible modules?**  
  *Modules are reusable, standalone scripts that Ansible runs on managed nodes (e.g., `copy`, `file`, `yum`, `service`).*  
- **Give an example of an Ansible ad-hoc command.**  
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping  
  ansible webservers -a "systemctl restart nginx"  
  ```
- **What is the difference between `shell` and `command` modules?**  
  *`shell` executes shell scripts and supports pipes (`|`), while `command` runs commands without shell features.*  

---

### **4. Variables, Vault, and Templates**
- **How do you define and use variables in Ansible?**  
  ```yaml
  vars:
    app_port: 8080
  tasks:
    - name: Print the app port
      debug:
        msg: "App runs on port {{ app_port }}"
  ```
- **What is Ansible Vault, and how is it used?**  
  *A security feature to encrypt sensitive data like passwords and API keys.*  
  ```bash
  ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml  
  ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass  
  ```
- **How do you use Jinja2 templates in Ansible?**  
  *Jinja2 templates allow dynamic file generation using variables.*  
  ```
  server_name={{ ansible_hostname }}
  ```
  ```yaml
  tasks:
    - name: Copy a templated file
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

---

### **5. Handlers, Loops, and Conditions**
- **What are handlers in Ansible?**  
  *Tasks that execute only when triggered by a `notify` statement (e.g., restarting services).*  
- **How do you use loops in Ansible?**  
  ```yaml
  tasks:
    - name: Install multiple packages
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - nginx
        - mysql
        - php
  ```
- **How do you apply conditions in Ansible?**  
  ```yaml
  tasks:
    - name: Run only on RHEL
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
  ```

---

### **6. Ansible Tower / AWX**
- **What is Ansible Tower/AWX?**  
  *A web-based UI for managing Ansible automation at scale.*  
- **How does RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) work in Ansible Tower?**  
  *It allows admins to control access to projects, inventories, and jobs.*  

---

### **7. Advanced Topics**
- **How do you handle idempotency in Ansible?**  
  *Ansible modules ensure tasks don’t make unnecessary changes (e.g., `state=present` in package installation).*  
- **What is the purpose of fact gathering in Ansible?**  
  *Ansible collects system information (e.g., OS, IP, CPU) using `ansible_facts`.*  
  ```yaml
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "OS is {{ ansible_os_family }}"
  ```
- **How do you debug an Ansible playbook?**  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml -vvv  
  ```
- **What is the difference between `block`, `rescue`, and `always` in Ansible?**  
  ```yaml
  tasks:
    - block:
        - name: Try to install a package
          yum:
            name: missing-package
            state: present
      rescue:
        - name: Handle failure
          debug:
            msg: "Installation failed"
      always:
        - name: Always execute this
          debug:
            msg: "This runs no matter what"
  ```

### **8. Bank-Specific Use Cases**
For a banking environment, they might ask:
- **How do you ensure security compliance in Ansible?**  
  *Using Ansible Vault, role-based access, and hardened playbooks.*  
- **How do you use Ansible to deploy applications in a highly regulated environment?**  
  *Using CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and strict version control.*  
- **How would you automate database patching using Ansible?**  
  *By scheduling Ansible jobs to check versions, take backups, apply patches, and validate.*  

---

### **Final Tip**
**Be prepared for hands-on questions!**  
- They might ask you to **write a playbook on the spot**.  
- You could be given **a failed playbook and asked to debug it**.  
- Expect **scenario-based questions** like *"How would you automate X in a banking system?"*
