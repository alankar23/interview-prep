# GAP

I had a gap in my work history due to a severe family health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I spent 20 days in the ICU and needed months to recover. After this period, I joined an organization but faced significant issues, including a toxic work culture and severe salary delays. Despite my efforts to maintain professionalism, I was unable to resolve these issues promptly and didn't receive my salary for three months. I have documentation to support this. I’m now eager to move forward and contribute positively to a new team.

# SALARY

I do understand that similar positions to the one I'm applying for offer salaries between X LPA to Y LPA. Given my educational background, years of experience and skills, I would expect to receive a salary in that range. However, I am open to
hear your thoughts regarding the same.

Based on current market rates for DevOps Engineers with my experience, a 150% raise reflects the industry standard for my skill set. I have over 3.9 years of experience in key technologies and have consistently delivered value by optimizing workflows and improving system performance. My previous role had compensation issues, but this request is aligned with the value I bring and my career growth goals. I am confident that my skills will significantly benefit your team.

## LOW BALL

Thank you for the offer. I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity and the company. However, based on my research and the value I bring, I was expecting a higher compensation package. With over 3.9 years in DevOps and proven achievements, I believe a salary in the range of [your desired amount] aligns better with industry standards and my experience. I’m open to discussing how we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.

## LOW BALL 2

I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but my final expectation is [your counteroffer], based on my skills and industry standards. If this offer cannot be adjusted to meet my needs, I may need to reconsider my position. Alternatively, if salary adjustments are not possible, I would be open to discussing other benefits or perks that could be adjusted. Thank you for your understanding

## COnflict
Situation: "We had a task to populate multiple countries and their city names in the database."

Task: "One of the Team Leads (TL) suggested using a CSV file he had created and directly dumping it into the database. I suggested implementing a database migration process within Spring Boot to handle the data population. However, he was concerned that this approach might bulk up the source code."

Action: "I knew that defending my stance could come across as having a big ego, so I took extra care to explain why the SQL dump approach might not be as effective. I pointed out that our databases are behind secure networks and do not have direct access, which could complicate the direct dump method. I suggested we have a one-on-one meeting to brainstorm ideas further, and he agreed. During the meeting, we outlined the pros and cons of each approach. I proposed using a tool called Liquibase, which would allow us to manage database migrations through the CI/CD pipeline. This solution would not only streamline the process but also provide version control over the data."

Result: "After our discussion, the TL agreed that using Liquibase was the more efficient and secure approach. We successfully implemented the solution, which allowed us to manage the database population effectively and ensured better version control and easier rollbacks for future changes."

## If i give you a project with 3 members and one month to complete it. how will you mange it and what will you do if one member does not perfom well

Define Clear Objectives and Scope:
    First, I would clarify the project goals, deliverables, and success criteria to ensure everyone understands what needs to be achieved within the one-month timeframe. I'd break down the project into smaller tasks and create a timeline with milestones.

Assign Roles and Responsibilities:
    Based on each team member's strengths, expertise, and workload, I would assign specific tasks to each person. I'd ensure that roles are clearly defined and that everyone knows what is expected of them.

Set Up Regular Check-Ins:
    I would establish daily stand-up meetings to track progress, discuss any blockers, and provide guidance. These check-ins would help maintain transparency and allow us to adjust our plans if needed.

Facilitate Collaboration and Communication:
    I’d set up collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira, or Trello) to ensure smooth communication and task tracking. This would also help in sharing updates, resources, and feedback in real-time.

Monitor Progress and Adjust as Needed:
    I would continuously monitor the progress against the project plan. If any task is lagging, I would assess the situation and reallocate resources or adjust timelines to stay on track.

Handling Underperformance:

Identify the Issue Early:
    If I notice one team member underperforming, I would first try to identify the reason. Is it due to a lack of skills, unclear instructions, personal issues, or something else? Early identification is crucial to address the problem effectively.

Have a Private Conversation:
    I’d have a one-on-one conversation with the team member to discuss their performance. I would ensure the conversation is supportive, not confrontational, focusing on understanding their perspective and identifying any obstacles they might be facing.

Provide Support and Resources:
    Depending on the issue, I might offer additional support, such as pairing them with a more experienced team member, providing training resources, or adjusting their workload temporarily.

Set Clear Expectations and Follow-Up:
    I would set specific, measurable goals and a timeline for improvement, making sure they understand what is expected. Regular follow-ups would help track progress and provide further guidance if needed.

Consider Reallocation of Tasks:
    If there is no significant improvement, I would consider redistributing critical tasks to other team members to ensure the project stays on track. I would still involve the underperforming member in meaningful ways, perhaps in a less critical area, to keep them engaged.

Maintain Team Morale:
    Throughout the process, I’d keep the rest of the team motivated and ensure they don’t feel overburdened due to the reallocation of tasks. Transparency about why adjustments are being made, without singling anyone out, is key to maintaining trust and morale.


## do like working as a team or solo?

I enjoy both, depending on the situation. Working as a team is great for collaboration, brainstorming, and tackling complex problems with diverse perspectives. However, I also value solo work for deep focus on tasks like scripting, debugging, or infrastructure setup. A balance of both is ideal for me
