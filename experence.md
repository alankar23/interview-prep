## How did you form a team

## do you like to work in team or individual
I enjoy both, depending on the situation. Working as a team is great for collaboration, brainstorming, and tackling complex problems with diverse perspectives. However, I also value solo work for deep focus on tasks like scripting, debugging, or infrastructure setup. A balance of both is ideal for me
