Absolutely! Here's a clear breakdown of the **Kubernetes (K8s) Architecture** and its key **components**, perfect for learning or interview prep. 👇

# 🧱 Kubernetes Architecture & Components

Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform** designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.

---

## 🌐 High-Level Architecture

Kubernetes follows a **master-worker** (control plane–node) architecture:

```
+--------------------+        +---------------------+
|  Control Plane     |<------>|     Nodes (Workers) |
+--------------------+        +---------------------+
```

- **Control Plane** – Brain of the cluster (manages the overall state).
- **Nodes (Worker Machines)** – Run actual applications (pods/containers).

---

## 🧠 Control Plane Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **kube-apiserver** | Entry point to the cluster; exposes Kubernetes API (REST). All communication happens through it. |
| **etcd** | Distributed key-value store; stores the cluster state/configuration. |
| **kube-scheduler** | Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Runs controllers to maintain the cluster state (e.g., node, replica, job controllers). |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | Manages cloud provider-specific logic (e.g., load balancers, storage provisioning). |

---

## 🖥️ Node (Worker) Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **kubelet** | Agent running on each node; communicates with the API server, manages Pod lifecycle. |
| **kube-proxy** | Handles network routing and forwards traffic to the correct pods/services. |
| **Container Runtime** | Software that runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O). |

---

## 🧩 Additional Concepts

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit; one or more containers with shared storage/network. |
| **Deployment** | Manages replicas and rolling updates for Pods. |
| **Service** | Stable network endpoint to expose Pods. Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer. |
| **Namespace** | Virtual cluster within a cluster; helps organize resources. |
| **ConfigMap / Secret** | Inject config data or sensitive values into Pods. |
| **Ingress** | Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services. |
| **Volumes** | Persistent or ephemeral storage attached to Pods. |
| **DaemonSet** | Ensures a Pod runs on all (or specific) nodes. |
| **StatefulSet** | Manages stateful apps (e.g., databases) with stable identities. |
| **Job / CronJob** | One-time or recurring tasks (batch jobs). |

---

## 🕸️ Networking Overview

- Every **Pod gets its own IP**.
- **kube-proxy** routes traffic between services and pods.
- **CNI plugins** (e.g., Calico, Flannel) manage low-level network setup.
