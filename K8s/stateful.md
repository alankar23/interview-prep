# Stateful Sets

StatefulSets are designed for stateful applications that require unique network identities and stable, persistent storage. They maintain a stable identity for each Pod and ensure ordered scaling, making them suitable for databases and other stateful workloads.

### **Key Differences Between StatefulSet and Deployment in Kubernetes**  

| Feature          | **StatefulSet** üèõÔ∏è | **Deployment** üöÄ |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Pod Identity** | Each pod has a stable, unique network identity (e.g., `my-app-0`, `my-app-1`). | Pods are interchangeable; no stable identity. |
| **Pod Ordering** | Ensures ordered deployment, scaling, and termination. | No guaranteed order for pod creation or termination. |
| **Storage** | Uses Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) that persist even if the pod is deleted. | Storage is typically ephemeral unless a PVC is manually assigned. |
| **Scaling Behavior** | New pods are created in sequence (`my-app-3` follows `my-app-2`). | All pods can be created or removed at the same time. |
| **Use Case** | Best for **stateful applications** like databases (MySQL, Kafka, Redis, etc.). | Best for **stateless applications** like web servers, API services. |
| **Headless Service Support** | Works with **headless services** (`clusterIP: None`) for direct pod communication. | Typically used with a **ClusterIP** service. |

### **Example YAML for Each**  

#### **StatefulSet Example (For Databases)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-db
spec:
  serviceName: "my-db-service"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-db
          image: mysql
          volumeMounts:
            - name: db-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: db-storage
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

#### **Deployment Example (For Web Apps)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: nginx
```

### **When to Use What?**
‚úÖ **Use a StatefulSet when:**
- You need stable, unique network identities (e.g., databases, Zookeeper, Kafka).  
- Persistent storage is required, and each pod must retain its data.  
- Pod startup and termination **order** is important.  

‚úÖ **Use a Deployment when:**
- Your application is **stateless** (e.g., API servers, web frontends).  
- You need **fast scaling** with interchangeable pods.  
- No persistent storage is required.
