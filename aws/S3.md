# AWS S3 Study Notes

## What is Amazon S3?
- **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
- Designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.
- Data is stored as **objects** within **buckets**.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Buckets
- A **bucket** is a container for storing objects in S3.
- Bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts.
- Each bucket is associated with a specific AWS region.

### 2. Objects
- An **object** is the fundamental entity stored in S3.
- Consists of:
  - **Key**: The name of the object (e.g., `photos/image.jpg`).
  - **Value**: The actual data (file content).
  - **Metadata**: Descriptive information about the object (e.g., content type, size).
  - **Version ID** (optional): Used for versioning.

### 3. Versioning
- Allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of an object.
- Protects against accidental deletion or overwrites.

### 4. Access Control
- Use **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** or **Bucket Policies** to manage permissions.
- IAM policies can also control access to S3 resources.

## S3 Storage Classes (Tiers)

AWS S3 provides multiple storage classes to optimize costs based on data access patterns:

### 1. **S3 Standard**
- **Use Case**: Frequently accessed data.
- **Features**:
  - High durability (99.999999999%) and availability (99.99%).
  - Low latency and high throughput.
- **Cost**: Higher cost due to frequent access.

### 2. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
- **Use Case**: Data with unknown or changing access patterns.
- **Features**:
  - Automatically moves data between two tiers: Frequent Access and Infrequent Access.
  - No retrieval fees.
- **Cost**: Cost-effective for unpredictable workloads.

### 3. **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**
- **Use Case**: Data accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
- **Features**:
  - Lower storage cost than S3 Standard.
  - Higher retrieval fees.
- **Cost**: Suitable for backups, disaster recovery, etc.

### 4. **S3 One Zone-IA**
- **Use Case**: Infrequently accessed data that doesnâ€™t require multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Features**:
  - Stored in a single AZ, reducing cost.
  - Lower durability compared to other classes.
- **Cost**: Cheaper than S3 Standard-IA.

### 5. **S3 Glacier**
- **Use Case**: Long-term archival data with rare access needs.
- **Features**:
  - Retrieval times range from minutes to hours.
  - Extremely low-cost storage.
- **Cost**: Ideal for compliance archives, old backups.

### 6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
- **Use Case**: Data accessed once or twice a year.
- **Features**:
  - Lowest-cost storage option.
  - Retrieval times can take up to 12 hours.
- **Cost**: Best for data that must be retained indefinitely.

### 7. **S3 Outposts**
- **Use Case**: On-premises storage with S3 API compatibility.
- **Features**:
  - Extends S3 to on-premises environments.
  - Fully managed by AWS.

## S3 Features

### 1. Lifecycle Policies
- Automate the transition of objects between storage classes or deletion.
- Example: Move data to S3 Glacier after 30 days of creation.

### 2. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- Replicate objects across different AWS regions for redundancy.

### 3. Server-Side Encryption
- Encrypt data at rest using:
  - **SSE-S3**: Managed by AWS.
  - **SSE-KMS**: Uses AWS Key Management Service.
  - **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys.

### 4. Multipart Upload
- Break large files into smaller parts for parallel uploads.
- Improves upload reliability and performance.

### 5. Event Notifications
- Trigger events (e.g., Lambda functions) when objects are created, deleted, or modified.

## Pricing Considerations
- **Storage Costs**: Vary by storage class.
- **Request Costs**: Charges for GET, PUT, LIST, etc.
- **Data Transfer Costs**: Moving data out of S3 incurs fees.
- **Retrieval Costs**: Applicable for Glacier and Deep Archive.

---

## Common Use Cases
- **Backup & Restore**: Store backups in S3 Standard-IA or Glacier.
- **Data Lakes**: Centralize large datasets for analytics.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Host static websites directly from S3.
- **Media Storage**: Store and serve images, videos, etc.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Enable Versioning**: Protect against accidental deletions.
2. **Use Lifecycle Policies**: Optimize costs by moving data to cheaper tiers.
3. **Encrypt Data**: Always enable encryption for sensitive data.
4. **Monitor Usage**: Use AWS CloudWatch and S3 metrics to track performance and costs.
5. **Secure Buckets**: Apply least privilege principles with IAM and bucket policies.

## FAQs
1. **What is the maximum size of an S3 object?**
   - Up to 5 TB per object.

2. **How durable is S3?**
   - 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.

3. **Can I host a website on S3?**
   - Yes, S3 supports static website hosting.

4. **What is the difference between S3 Standard-IA and One Zone-IA?**
   - S3 Standard-IA stores data in multiple AZs, while One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ.

5. **How do I reduce S3 costs?**
   - Use lifecycle policies, choose the right storage class, and monitor usage patterns.
