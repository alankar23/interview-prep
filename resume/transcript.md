**Speaker Notes / Transcript:**

Alright, so let's start with the big question — what is DevOps?

You’ll hear a lot of definitions, but I like to keep it simple.

> DevOps is about **developers who think like operations engineers**,  
> and **operations teams who think like developers**.

Let me explain what that means.

Traditionally, developers wrote the code. Once they were done, they'd throw it over the wall to the operations team, and say,  
“Here you go, make it work in production.”

And the ops team would be responsible for running that code — dealing with infrastructure, fixing outages, keeping systems stable.

This created a lot of friction — bugs, failed deployments, and that classic back-and-forth:  
_“It works on my machine!”_

So DevOps came in to **break down that wall**.

Now:

- Developers start to **care about how their code runs in real-world environments** — they get involved in deployment, monitoring, and performance.
  
- And operations folks start to **use code to manage infrastructure** — things like scripting, version control, automation, even writing tests for infrastructure.

So both sides **collaborate**, they **share responsibility**, and they work together to **build and run better software faster**.

And that, in a nutshell, is what DevOps is all about.

**Speaker Notes / Transcript:**

Now let’s look at what DevOps engineers actually do in real-world projects.

These are some of the key responsibilities and skills we work with on a daily basis:

---

🔁 **CI/CD Management**  
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery or Deployment.

As DevOps engineers, we set up pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy code every time a developer makes a change.  
This helps teams release updates faster and more reliably — without manual steps or late-night deployment panic.

---

🤖 **Automating Boring Tasks**  
One of our main goals is to **remove repetitive manual work**.

For example:  
- Restarting servers  
- Backups
- Cleanup tasks
- Scheduled Jobs
- Running deployments  
- Creating cloud environments  
These things can — and should — be automated.

We use scripts, tools like Ansible or Bash, and CI pipelines to make things happen with a single command or click.

---

💻 **Infrastructure as Code and Automation**  
Instead of manually setting up servers or cloud resources, we write code to define infrastructure.

This is called **Infrastructure as Code**, or IaC.

- No Click Ops
- Reproduceability and Faster
- Everyone would know the configuration

Using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, we can version control our infrastructure, track changes, and spin up environments consistently and reliably.

---

📊 **Observability and Monitoring**  
Once an app is deployed, our job isn’t done — we need to make sure it's healthy.

That’s where monitoring and observability come in.

- without it env is a blackbox
- what is happening (failing requests, how much load, how much traffic, etc). n number of things can be configured and data can be sent.


We use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to track logs, metrics, and alerts.  
This helps us detect issues early, measure performance, and keep everything running smoothly.

---

📦 **Containerization**  
We often package applications in containers using Docker.

Containers make apps portable and consistent across different environments — whether it’s your laptop, a staging server, or production.

It also simplifies scaling and makes deployments more predictable.

---

⚙️ **Orchestration**  
When you have many containers running, you need something to manage them — that’s where orchestration comes in.

Tools like Kubernetes help us automatically deploy, scale, and manage containers across clusters of machines.

Think of it like air traffic control — making sure everything is running in the right place, at the right time, with zero downtime.

---

👨‍🔧 So in short, DevOps isn't about just one tool — it's about building **automated, reliable, and scalable systems** that support development teams and business goals.


## Slide: Why Docker?

---

**Speaker Notes / Transcript:**

Let’s talk about Docker — one of the most important tools in DevOps today.

---

🐳 **What is Docker?**  
Docker is a tool that lets you **package your application and everything it needs — into one container**.

That means the code, the libraries, the system tools — all bundled together.

---

🤔 **Why do we need it? What problem does it solve?**  
Let me give you a common problem:

> "It works on my machine!"  
> — every developer, ever

Docker solves that.

Because once your app is in a container, it **runs exactly the same** — on your laptop, in staging, in production, or in the cloud.

---

✅ **What Docker solves:**
- No more “works on my machine” issues
- Environment consistency
- Easy to run, share, and deploy applications
- Lightweight compared to virtual machines
- Great support for microservices and CI/CD pipelines

---

## Slide: Why Kubernetes?

---

**Speaker Notes / Transcript:**

So Docker is great — but what happens when you have **10… 100… or even thousands of containers** running your app?

That’s where Kubernetes comes in.

---

☸️ **What is Kubernetes?**  
Kubernetes — or K8s — is a **container orchestration platform**.  
It helps you **deploy, scale, manage, and monitor containers** automatically.

---

🔧 **What problems does Kubernetes solve?**
Imagine this:

- You have 5 containers running your app
- One of them crashes — what happens?
- Traffic spikes — how do you scale?
- You need zero-downtime updates — how do you roll them out?

Kubernetes handles all of that.

---

✅ **What Kubernetes solves:**
- **Auto-healing** — it restarts containers if they crash
- **Scaling** — adds or removes containers based on traffic
- **Rolling updates** — deploy new versions without downtime
- **Load balancing** — distributes traffic evenly
- **Declarative configuration** — you tell K8s what you want, and it makes it happen

---

Together, Docker and Kubernetes are a **powerful combo**.

Docker helps you build and run your app in containers.  
Kubernetes helps you **manage those containers at scale**.
